    <h1>Malaysia's Mortality Analysis</h1>
    <p>Exploring the Population Trends and Death Patterns Across Malaysia (2000–2023)</p>

<section>
  <h2>Which States in Malaysia have the Highest Deathrates?</h2>
  <hr>
  <div id="map_vis" class="chart-container"></div>
  <hr>

  <div class="analysis-text">
    <p>
      From the <b>choropleth map</b>, it can be observed that generally,
      states with <b>larger populations</b> tend to show more consistent
      death rate patterns across regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      States such as <b>Selangor</b>, <b>Kuala Lumpur</b>, and <b>Penang</b>
      tend to have a more <b>moderate death rate</b> compared to others.
    </p>

    <p>
      This could be due to <b>better healthcare access</b> and
      <b>higher living standards</b> in these urbanized areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast, <b>Perak</b>, <b>Perlis</b>, <b>Kelantan</b>, and
      <b>Sabah</b> often show <b>higher death rates</b> per 100,000 people.
    </p>

    <p>
      This might be because of <b>limited healthcare access</b>,
      <b>weaker infrastructure</b>, or a <b>larger aging population</b>
      in those regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other states in Malaysia, shows a more <b>consistent</b> death rate with not much fluctuation
      between the years.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Do Death Patterns Differ by Gender & Ethnicity? </h2>
    <hr>
  <div id="bar_vis" class="chart-container"></div>
    <hr>

  <div class="analysis-text">
    <p>
      From the visualisation, <b>states such as Selangor, Johor, and Perak</b> 
      record the highest total number of deaths, which corresponds 
      with their larger population sizes.
    </p>

    <p>
      When comparing between sexes, <b>males consistently have higher death counts</b> 
      than females across most states, suggesting potential lifestyle 
      or occupational risk differences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among ethnic groups, <b>Bumiputera Malay deaths form the largest share</b>, 
      followed by Chinese and Indian populations. This is a pattern that broadly 
      reflects Malaysia’s demographic composition.
    </p>

    <p>
      Smaller states such as <b>Perlis, Labuan, and Putrajaya</b> show noticeably 
      lower death counts, aligning with their lower population bases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, the visualisation shows a <b> difference</b> in death patterns between
      gender & ethnic groups in Malaysia. So in a sense, death patterns do differ, but it is
      more <b>influcenced by the population size</b> rather than the ethnic or gender itself.
    </p>
  </div>

<section>
  <h2> How has the States in Malaysia Grown over the years? (2000-2023)</h2>
    <hr>
  <div id="line_vis" class="chart-container"></div>
  <hr>
<div class="analysis-text">
  <p>
    From <b>2000 to 2023</b>, Malaysia’s population shows an overall
    <b>upward trend</b> across most states, with notable differences
    in growth rate.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Selangor</b> records the steepest increase, driven by its
    <b>economic opportunities</b>, <b>higher standard of living</b> &  its<b> strategic location</b>
    while <b>Johor</b> and <b>Penang</b> also show steady growth which might be due to the
    <b>industrial and commercial expansion</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    States such as <b>Kedah</b>, <b>Perak</b>, <b>Negeri Sembilan</b>,
    and <b>Pahang</b> experience <b>moderate growth</b>, which indicate that developments
    might have started to begin there.
  </p>

  <p>
    In contrast, <b>Kelantan</b>, <b>Terengganu</b>, and <b>Perlis</b>
    show <b>minimal </b> changes, suggesting slower urbanisation and
    little opportunities to grow economically.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Kuala Lumpur’s</b> population growth appears to level off in
    recent years, possibly due to <b>limited space</b> in the area and recent
    migration to <b> Selangor </b> as it is more <b>affordable</b> overall.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Putrajaya</b> shows a steady rise after the
    early 2000s, consistent with its development as the
    <b>administrative capital</b> of Malaysia. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, the visualisation reveals <b>Malaysia’s continuous
    population expansion</b>, with faster growth concentrated in
    <b>economically active and urbanised states</b>.
  </p>
</div>

  <section>
    <h2>Are Gender Ratios the same across the Ethnic Groups in Malaysia?</h2>
      <hr>
    <div id="pie_vis" class="chart-container"></div>
      <hr>
  <p>
    Across Malaysia, the gender distribution is <b>fairly balanced</b>, 
    though <b>males consistently make up a slightly larger portion</b> of the population than females.
  </p>

  <p>
    This pattern can be seen across all three major ethnic groups:
    <b>Bumiputera Malay</b>, <b>Chinese</b>, and <b>Indian</b> 
    which have been showing a consistent trend over the years.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <b>Bumiputera Malay</b> community forms the largest share of the population, 
    followed by the <b>Chinese</b> and then the <b>Indian</b> group.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, the visualisation reflects <b>Malaysia’s stable demographic structure</b> 
    with only minor variations between genders and ethnicities.
  </p>

  </section>

<section>
  <h2>Does Death Rate Correspond to Population Size?</h2>
  <hr>
  <div id="splot_vis" class="chart-container"></div>
  <hr>

  <p>
    From the visualisation, it can be seen that <b>Perak</b> and <b>Perlis</b> 
    consistently record <b>higher death rates</b> across the years. Whereby <b>Perak's </b>
    death rate peaked at <b>8428</b> people in <b>2022</b> while <b>Perlis</b> peaked <b>7422</b> in <b>2018</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than<b> Perlis </b> and <b>Perak</b>, <b>Sabah</b> also shows up with one of the highest amount of death
    rate in <b>2020</b> throughout the year 2000-2023 with <b>7884 people</b> for that year alone. This might be due 
    to <b>Covid-19 pandemic</b> whereby Sabah was one of the worst hit states during that period.
  </p>
  <p>
    This suggests that <b>population size alone does not determine the death rate</b> 
    in each state.
  </p>

  <p>
    States such as <b>Selangor</b> and <b>Kuala Lumpur</b> have 
    <b>larger populations but have lower death rates</b>, 
    which could be due to better access to healthcare facilities, 
    higher living standards and stronger public health systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, <b>Perak</b> and <b>Perlis</b> generally have 
    <b>smaller populations but higher death rates</b>. 
    This may be influenced by <b>limited healthcare access</b>
    and <b>slower socioeconomic development</b>. 
    Rural areas that usually make up most of these states, often have 
    a higher concentration of elderly residents, naturally leading to 
    increased mortality rates.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, the visualisation highlights that <b>death rate is shaped by multiple factors</b> 
    which includes demographics, healthcare accessibility, and socioeconomic conditions
    rather than just the total population size of a state.
